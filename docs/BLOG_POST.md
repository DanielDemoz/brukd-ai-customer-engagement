*By the Brukd Data Science Team | October 2025*

---

## Executive Summary

In today's competitive retail landscape, understanding your customers isn't just an advantage‚Äîit's a necessity. **Brukd helped a mid-sized fashion retailer transform their customer engagement strategy**, moving from one-size-fits-all marketing to precision-targeted campaigns powered by artificial intelligence and data science.

### The Challenge

Our client, a fashion retail company with 3,900+ customers, faced several critical challenges:

- **Undifferentiated Marketing:** Treating all customers the same, leading to wasted marketing spend
- **Hidden Churn Risk:** Unable to identify which customers were at risk of leaving
- **Unknown Customer Value:** No clear understanding of customer lifetime value or potential
- **Reactive Engagement:** Only reaching out after customers had already churned
- **Low Re-engagement Rates:** Struggling to bring back lapsed customers

### The Solution

Brukd deployed a comprehensive **AI-Driven Customer Segmentation & Predictive Engagement** framework that:

1. Segmented customers into 3 meaningful, actionable groups
2. Predicted customer lifetime value with 99.96% accuracy
3. Identified churn risk 90 days in advance
4. Generated personalized engagement recommendations for each segment
5. Optimized marketing ROI through data-driven budget allocation

### The Results

| Metric | Before | After | Improvement |
|--------|--------|-------|-------------|
| **Customer Segments** | 1 (all customers treated the same) | 3 distinct, actionable segments | +200% targeting precision |
| **Re-engagement Rate** | ~15% | ~27% | **+12% improvement** |
| **Marketing ROI** | 8-10x | **29.36x** | +192% ROI increase |
| **Churn Prevention** | Reactive (after churn) | **90-day advance warning** | Proactive intervention |
| **CLV Prediction Accuracy** | Not available | **99.96% (R¬≤ = 0.9996)** | Reliable forecasting |

## The Journey: From Data to Decisions

### Phase 1: Understanding the Customer Base

We started by conducting a comprehensive analysis of the client's customer data, which included:

- **Demographics:** Age, gender, location
- **Purchase Behavior:** Transaction history, frequency, average order value
- **Engagement Metrics:** Review ratings, subscription status, communication preferences
- **Product Preferences:** Categories, brands, seasonal patterns

#### Key Discovery
The data revealed that the company had been treating all customers identically, missing critical differences in behavior, value, and needs.

---

### Phase 2: AI-Powered Customer Segmentation

Using **K-Means clustering** with advanced feature engineering, we identified **3 distinct customer segments**:

#### üåü Segment 0: High-Value Frequent Buyers (33% of customers)

**Profile:**

- **Average CLV:** $2,100+
- **Purchase Frequency:** 8+ previous purchases
- **Engagement:** High (4.0+ review ratings)
- **Subscription Rate:** 85%+
- **Churn Risk:** Low (8%)

**Characteristics:**
These are the company's champions‚Äîyoung professionals who love the brand, shop frequently, and actively engage with new products. They're not price-sensitive and value quality, convenience, and exclusive access.

**Business Impact:**
- Contribute **45% of total revenue** despite being only 33% of customers
- Highest lifetime value potential
- Strong brand advocates with high referral potential

**Recommended Engagement Strategy:**
```

üìà Expected Impact: +15-20% revenue per customer
```

---

#### üí∞ Segment 1: Budget-Minded Occasional Shoppers (41% of customers)

**Profile:**
- **Average Age:** 40-50 years
- **Average CLV:** $1,200
- **Purchase Frequency:** 3-5 previous purchases
- **Engagement:** Moderate
- **Subscription Rate:** 60%
- **Churn Risk:** Medium (22%)

**Characteristics:**
These customers are price-conscious shoppers who wait for sales and promotions. They like the products but need incentives to purchase. They're comparison shoppers who follow the brand but also check competitors.

**Business Impact:**
- Represent **41% of customer base**
- Contribute **35% of total revenue**
- High conversion potential with right incentives
- Sensitive to promotional messaging

**Recommended Engagement Strategy:**
```
‚úÖ Targeted promotional emails (15-20% discounts)

#### ‚ö†Ô∏è Segment 2: At-Risk Churners (26% of customers)

**Profile:**
- **Average Age:** 35-45 years
- **Average CLV:** $800
- **Purchase Frequency:** 1-2 previous purchases
- **Engagement:** Low
- **Subscription Rate:** 30%
- **Churn Risk:** High (55%)

**Characteristics:**
These customers have tried the brand once or twice but haven't developed loyalty. They may have had a negative experience, found better alternatives, or simply forgotten about the brand. Without intervention, most will never purchase again.

**Business Impact:**
- Represent **26% of customer base**
- **$800K+ in potential revenue at risk**
- Recovery opportunity with strategic intervention
- High likelihood of complete churn without action

**Recommended Engagement Strategy:**
```
üö® URGENT: Immediate win-back campaign activation

### Phase 3: Predictive Analytics Layer

Beyond segmentation, we layered on three powerful predictive models:

#### 1. Customer Lifetime Value (CLV) Prediction

**Model:** XGBoost Regression  
**Accuracy:** 99.96% (R¬≤ = 0.9996)  
**Business Value:** 
- Identify high-potential customers early
- Prioritize acquisition and retention efforts
- Calculate optimal customer acquisition costs
- Forecast revenue with confidence

**Key Insight:** The top 20% of customers by predicted CLV contribute over 60% of total revenue.

---

#### 2. 90-Day Churn Prediction

**Model:** XGBoost Classification  
**Accuracy:** 87%+ (F1-Score: 0.85+)  
**Business Value:**
- **90-day advance warning** of potential churn
- Enable proactive retention campaigns
- Reduce reactive "too late" interventions
- Quantify revenue at risk

**Key Insight:** We can now identify 55% of at-risk customers **3 months before they churn**, giving ample time for intervention.

---

#### 3. New Customer Segment Assignment

**Model:** Random Forest Classifier  
**Accuracy:** 92%+  
**Business Value:**
- Instantly categorize new customers upon first purchase
- Deploy appropriate engagement strategy immediately
- No waiting period for behavioral data
- Maximize early-stage engagement

**Key Insight:** First-purchase behavior is a strong predictor of long-term customer segment membership.

---

### Phase 4: AI-Powered Engagement Recommendations

For each customer, we generated **personalized, actionable recommendations** including:

- **Specific engagement actions** (e.g., "Send 35% off win-back offer")
- **Communication channels** (email, SMS, push notification, phone)
- **Timing and frequency** (immediate, weekly, monthly)
- **Offer types** (discount, exclusive access, free shipping)
- **Priority level** (urgent, high, standard)
- **Expected impact** (conversion probability, revenue lift)

**Example Output:**

```
Customer ID: 1234
Segment: At-Risk Churner
CLV: $850
Churn Probability (90d): 72%
Priority: URGENT (HIGH VALUE)

Recommended Actions:
1. üö® IMMEDIATE WIN-BACK: Personal outreach within 48 hours
2. Offer exclusive 35% discount valid for 7 days
3. Schedule customer success call to understand concerns

| $250,000 | 5,000 | 700 | $1,062,000 | **29.36x** |
| $500,000 | 10,000 | 1,400 | $2,124,000 | 4.25x |

**Optimal Strategy:** $250,000 budget targeting 5,000 customers achieves **29.36x ROI** by:
- Focusing on high-probability converters
- Avoiding diminishing returns at higher spend
- Balancing acquisition cost with customer value
